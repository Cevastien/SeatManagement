## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "View not found" error
**Solution:** Make sure `staffverification.blade.php` exists in `resources/views/kiosk/`

### Issue: API returns 404
**Solution:** Run `php artisan route:clear` to clear route cache

### Issue: Staff dashboard doesn't show pending requests
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors, verify API endpoint is working

### Issue: Customer screen doesn't auto-redirect
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for polling errors
- Verify verification_id is set correctly
- Check if staff actually completed verification

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution:** Run migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan db:seed
```

---

## Database Check

### View Pending Verifications:
```sql
SELECT * FROM priority_verifications WHERE status = 'pending';
```

### View All Verifications:
```sql
SELECT * FROM priority_verifications ORDER BY requested_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Clear Test Data:
```sql
DELETE FROM priority_verifications WHERE customer_name LIKE '%Test%';
```
